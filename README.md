# Blocklist and Allowlist based on forum reading, ad source checking etc.

Based on personal experience with sites and blocklists, **comments** are added in raw files to show where different sources came from and what the reason behind them were (not all may have this).

Allowlist works *only* with services that support it e.g. AdGuard (Not Pihole)
| Allowlist | [Click Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harris-KA/Adguard-and-pihole-lists/main/allowlist.txt) ✅ |
|--|--|

Blocklist work in progress :)
| Blocklist | Not Yet ❌ |

These are both still new and am working them out!
